Right in the heart of the city center of Kandy is the man-made lake called Kiri Muhuda (Sinhala: the sea of milk), the one and only decorative lake in Sri Lanka. All other thousands of man-made reservoirs in Sri Lanka are developed primarily for the purposes of irrigation, and secondarily for the purposes of general use and wildlife conservation.Built in the medieval era, the lovely lake is encircled by a short white-washed parapet called Valakulu Bamma (Sinhala: Embankment of clouds) with the pedestrian pavement and motor road running next to the parapet. In the center of the lake is an Island.Southwestern corner of the lake makes way- a just a few steps - to the garden of the Temple of the Tooth. Udawattakele Bird Sanctuary with its densely wooded green hills looms over the red tile roofs and golden canopy of the Temple of the Tooth. Located within the courtyard of the Temple of Tooth are Tourist Office and Cultural Triangle Office.Kandy is home to a multitude of medieval Buddhist temples. Great Kandy Esala Perahera Pageant, the yearly grand homage-rainmaker celebration in exposition of Tooth Relic of Buddha around the city is one great methodical riot of fire, light and sounds of fire play dancers, drummer dancers, dancers, drummers, piper dancers, pipers and caparisoned elephants.Kandy is the transportation hub of the Central province; it is also the gateway to the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka.

		<h2>ETYMOLOGY</h2>
		
		<img src="ETYMOLOGY.jpg" align="right" width="40%">
		<p>The city and the region have been known by many different names and versions of those names. Some scholars suggest that the original name of Kandy was Katubulu Nuwara located near the present Watapuluwa. However, the more popular historical name is Senkadagala or Senkadagalapura, officially Senkadagala Siriwardhana Maha Nuwara (meaning 'great city of Senkadagala of growing resplendence'), generally shortened to 'Maha Nuwara'. According to folklore, this name originated from one of the several possible sources. One being the city was named after a brahmin with the name Senkanda who lived in a cave nearby, and another being a queen of Vikramabahu III was named Senkanda, and after a coloured stone named Senkadagala. The Kingdom of Kandy has also been known by various names. The English name Kandy, which originated during the colonial era, is derived from an anglicised version of the Sinhala Kanda Uda Rata (meaning the land on the mountain) or Kanda Uda Pas Rata (the five counties/countries on the mountain). The Portuguese shortened this to "Candea", using the name for both the kingdom and its capital. In Sinhala, Kandy is called Maha nuwara, meaning "Great City" or "The Capital", although this is most often shortened to Nuwara</p>
